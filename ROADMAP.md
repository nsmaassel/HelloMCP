# HelloMCP Project Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the development roadmap for the HelloMCP project, which demonstrates multiple approaches to creating and deploying Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. The project aims to provide practical examples, best practices, and learning resources for developers interested in MCP implementation.

## Project Objectives

- Demonstrate three distinct approaches to MCP server implementation:
  - Azure Functions (serverless)
  - Docker (containerized)
  - .NET SDK with Semantic Kernel
- Provide practical, working examples that follow MCP best practices
- Create comprehensive documentation for each approach
- Share knowledge and insights gained during implementation

## Learning Goals

- Understand MCP server architecture and protocol requirements
- Compare deployment options and their trade-offs
- Implement authentication and session management in MCP servers
- Master both modern (Streamable HTTP) and legacy (HTTP+SSE) MCP transports
- Learn effective testing strategies for MCP servers

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Planning (Current Phase)

- [x] Initialize project repository
- [x] Create basic folder structure
- [x] Set up GitHub Copilot environment
- [x] Create this roadmap document
- [ ] Set up development environments for each approach
- [ ] Establish coding standards and conventions

**Milestone:** Project structure established and ready for implementation

### Phase 2: Implementation - Azure Functions MCP

- [ ] Research Azure Functions MCP implementation best practices
- [ ] Set up Azure Functions development environment
- [ ] Implement core MCP endpoints
- [ ] Add authentication and session management
- [ ] Support both Streamable HTTP and HTTP+SSE transports
- [ ] Add logging and error handling
- [ ] Deploy to Azure

**Milestone:** Functioning Azure Functions MCP server deployed

### Phase 3: Implementation - Docker MCP

- [ ] Research Docker-based MCP implementation best practices
- [ ] Create Dockerfile and container configuration
- [ ] Implement core MCP endpoints
- [ ] Add authentication and session management
- [ ] Support both transport options
- [ ] Add logging and error handling
- [ ] Push container to registry

**Milestone:** Docker container for MCP server created and published

### Phase 4: Implementation - .NET SDK/Semantic Kernel MCP

- [ ] Research Semantic Kernel integration with MCP
- [ ] Set up .NET SDK and Semantic Kernel
- [ ] Implement core MCP endpoints
- [ ] Add authentication and session management
- [ ] Support both transport options
- [ ] Add logging and error handling

**Milestone:** Functioning .NET SDK MCP server with Semantic Kernel integration

### Phase 5: Testing

- [ ] Create test suite for MCP protocol compliance
- [ ] Implement integration tests for each server type
- [ ] Perform load/stress testing
- [ ] Address identified issues and optimize performance

**Milestone:** All implementations tested and validated

### Phase 6: Documentation and Examples

- [ ] Update README files with comprehensive instructions
- [ ] Add code comments and annotations
- [ ] Create usage examples for each implementation
- [ ] Document known limitations and edge cases

**Milestone:** Comprehensive documentation completed

### Phase 7: Knowledge Sharing

- [ ] Create tutorial blog post series
- [ ] Prepare demonstration videos
- [ ] Compile learnings and insights
- [ ] Create comparison matrix of approaches

**Milestone:** Knowledge sharing materials published
